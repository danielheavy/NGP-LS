Hi everyone!</br>
This is the repository to implement neat-GP with LocalSearch (which we call it neat-GP-LS) on python-deap.
You just have to clone the repository to test it. </br>

The previous software that you'll need are:<br>
-Python 2.7 https://www.python.org/downloads/<br>
-DEAP 1.0.2 or 1.1.0 http://deap.gel.ulaval.ca/doc/dev/installation.html<br>
-numpy http://www.numpy.org/ <br>
-scipy http://www.scipy.org/<br>
</br>
</br>
And that's all. <br>
If you have a problem please contact me: pjuarez@tree-lab.org <br>
Regards!<br>
